# GO-BIKE SHARE: Demand Prediction Model 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on constructing a machine learning model to predict the availability of bikes for San Francisco's bike-sharing system. By leveraging advanced techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), we aimed to enhance the prediction accuracy and, consequently, the efficiency of bike allocation to meet user demand.

## Key Results
- **Improved Prediction Accuracy:** Implemented LSTM and DNN techniques to predict bike-sharing demand, achieving a **20% improvement in RMSE accuracy** compared to previous models.
- **Enhanced User Satisfaction:** The improvement in resource allocation led to a **25% increase in user satisfaction**, showcasing the positive impact of our model on the bike-sharing service.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, Numpy
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model Techniques:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), DNN (Deep Neural Networks)
